# Flood_Exposure_Calculator
A tool to assess the potential flooding of properties.

Required are building geometries (polygon shapefil) and an xyz inundation layer.

Within a buffer area around the building geometries, the mean and maximum inundation depths are established to classify the property's susceptibility from flooding.
